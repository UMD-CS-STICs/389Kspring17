## Week 8

This week, we will be going over **databases** and **MongoDB**. 

First, we will need to set up MongoDB so we can use it during class. Please make sure you have this ready and working before class starts. 

There are two options for running an instance of MongoDB:

1. Install and run on our local machine
2. Use a service and run it in the "cloud"

For simplicity, we will be using **mlab**, a MongoDB hosting service. Below are instructions on how to make an account and get started: 


1) **Go to http://mlab.com and click `SIGN UP`. Create a new account.**
