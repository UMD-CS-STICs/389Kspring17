## Week 2

Thanks for the great first class! 

Our next class will be dedicated to learning the Javascript language. 

Once again, here are two resources we would like for you to read before class. The only purpose is to help you get a head start and some context before teaching it in class. In addition, they cover some smaller, but very important details that we may not touch on in class. 

1. **Learn X in Y Minutes: Javascript**

    Very fast introduction to Javascript. You know many languages, and this document will help you transfer that knowledge to Javascript.

2. **MDN Introduction to Javascript**

    An EXTREMELY good introduction to Javascript that basically covers the whole language and many of its advanced features. 

    There is no need to read the whole thing, but keep it as a resource and skim through it.
