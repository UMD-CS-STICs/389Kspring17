    1. Implement the input element.
            You'll need to answer the the following questions (and probably more):
            1. What HTML tag inserts an input element?
            2. How do I continuously check the contents of the input element without the user hitting enter?
            3. How do I disable the input bar if the game is not in session?
    -->

    <!--
    2. Implement the running list of states.
        1. What HTML will be inserted each time a user enters a correct state?
        2. How can I make sure the user can see all the states he/she has
        already entered?
        3. How will I trigger the network request to get a state's senators on
        hover?
        4. How will I seperate the entered states from missed states when the game is over if the user lost the game?
    -->

    <!--
    3. Implement the timer. This is almost all JavaScript.
     -->

    <!--
    4. Implement the start button. The start button must activate the input box to allow input start the timer.
